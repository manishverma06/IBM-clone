    <p><b>International Business Machines Corporation</b> (using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark">trademark</a> IBM), nicknamed Big Blue,<sup>[6]</sup> is an American<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation"> multinational technology company</a> headquartered in Armonk, New York, and present in over 175 countries.<sup>[7][8]</sup> It is a publicly traded company and one of the 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.<sup>[a][9][10]</sup> IBM is the largest industrial research organization in the world, with 19 research facilities across a dozen countries; for 29 consecutive years, from 1993 to 2021, it held the record for most annual U.S. patents generated by a business.</p>

    <p>IBM was founded in 1911 as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing-Tabulating-Recording_Company">Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company</a> (CTR), a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holding_company">holding company</a> of manufacturers of record-keeping and measuring systems. It was renamed "International Business Machines" in 1924 and soon became the leading manufacturer of punch-card tabulating systems. During the 1960s and 1970s, the IBM mainframe, exemplified by the System/360 and its successors, was the world's dominant computing platform, with the company producing 80 percent of computers in the U.S. and 70 percent of computers worldwide.<sup>[11]</sup> Embracing both business and scientific computing, System/360 was the first family of computers designed to cover a complete range of applications from small to large.<sup>[12]</sup></p>

    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Party">Nazis</a> made extensive use of Hollerith punch card and alphabetical accounting equipment and IBM's majority-owned German subsidiary, Deutsche Hollerith Maschinen GmbH (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehomag">Dehomag</a>), supplied this equipment from the early 1930s. This equipment was critical to Nazi efforts to categorize citizens of both Germany and other nations that fell under Nazi control through ongoing censuses. These census data were used to facilitate the round-up of Jews and other targeted groups, and to catalog their movements through the machinery of the Holocaust, including internment in the concentration camps.<sup>[32]</sup> Black contends that IBM's dealings with Nazis through its New York City headquarters persisted during World War II.<sup>[33]</sup> Nazi concentration camps operated a Hollerith department called Hollerith Abteilung, which had IBM machines, including calculating and sorting machines.<sup>[34]</sup></p>

    <p>On April 7, 1964, IBM launched the first computer system family, the ,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360">IBM System/360</a>. It spanned the complete range of commercial and scientific applications from large to small, allowing companies for the first time to upgrade to models with greater computing capability without having to rewrite their applications. It was followed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/370">IBM System/370</a> in 1970. Together the 360 and 370 made the IBM mainframe the dominant mainframe computer and the dominant computing platform in the industry throughout this period and into the early 1980s. They and the operating systems that ran on them such as OS/VS1 and MVS, and the middleware built on top of those such as the CICS transaction processing monitor, had a near-monopoly-level market share and became the thing IBM was most known for during this period.<sup>[35]</sup></p>

<p>In 1969, the United States of America alleged that IBM violated the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act"> Sherman Antitrust Act</a> by monopolizing or attempting to monopolize the general-purpose electronic digital computer system market, specifically computers designed primarily for business, and subsequently alleged that IBM violated the antitrust laws in IBM's actions directed against leasing companies and plug-compatible peripheral manufacturers. Shortly after, IBM unbundled its software and services in what many observers believed was a direct result of the lawsuit, creating a competitive market for software. In 1982, the Department of Justice dropped the case as "without merit".<sup>[36]</sup>

<p>In 1998, IBM merged the enterprise-oriented Personal Systems Group of the IBM PC Co. into IBM's own Global Services personal computer consulting and customer service division. The resulting merged business units then became known simply as IBM Personal Systems Group.<sup>[55]</sup> A year later, IBM stopped selling their computers at retail outlets after their market share in this sector had fallen considerably behind competitors <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compaq">Compaq</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell"> Dell</a>.<sup>[56]</sup> Immediately afterwards, the IBM PC Co. was dissolved and merged into IBM Personal Systems Group.<sup>[57]</sup></p>
